# Backstory

Deep in the heart of the Gigol Jungle there's a tribe that's tasked with protecting three elemental gems, the gems of earth, fire, and water. One day the tribe came under attack from a powerful foe and to protect the gems the tribe's elders split the gems into shards and hid them throughout Gigol Jungle.

Now it is up to you to sort through the gems of Gigol Jungle to find the missing shards!
