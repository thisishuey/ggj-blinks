# Gameplay

After completing the steps in [Setup](setup.md), you should now have 18 blinks set facedown (showing a dim green).

- 18 gem shard blinks in three colors (red, yellow, blue) 6 blinks per colo with the values 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3
- 3 pennies
- 2 nickels

Objective

This is a coop game very with modified rules of the game Hanabi.

This is a cooperative game, you will be trying to rebuild The Lost Gems by grouping shards of incremental numbers of the appropriate colored gem without actually being able to see the shards in your hand. Instead, you will depend on clues from the other player to determine what shards you hold in your hand. The more gems you complete, the higher score your team will earn at the end of the game.

Gameplay

Set the three pennies heads up on the table, these will be used to keep track of the number of clues your team has to give.

Set the two nickels heads up on the table, these will be used to keep track of any errors, if you run out of nickels it's game over, 0 points!

Shuffle the blinks. I find it's easiest to split the blinks into two groups and then start grabbing a random blink out of each group and collect them into a third group. If you find other ways that are easier to shuffle, please feel free.

Once the blinks are shuffled, each player will grab 2 shards from the pile and set them on one of their edges in front of themselves with the green LEDs facing away from you, they have a natural attaction at the points which I find useful for stabalizing them. This is your hand, onces the faces of the blinks are properly hidden from your view, you can double click each one to show the other player both the shards in your hands.

**IMPORTANT!** Make sure to not look at the shards in your hand, this is an important play mechanic of the game.

The remaining shards are left in the center of the table representing the treetops of Gigol Jungle.

The player with the next birthday goes first.

When it is your turn, you must do exactly one of the following:

1. Give a hint
2. Discard a shard
3. Play a shard

You must perform one and only one, you cannot skip your turn.

### Giving a Hint

When you give a hint, you must flip a penny from heads to tails, if there are no more heads up pennies to flip then you cannot give a hint this turn and must choose one of the other options instead to try to get back more hints.

#### Types of Hints

- **Color Hint:** You can give your teammate a clue about the color of their shards, e.g. "this shard is red", "these shards are green", "this/these shard(s) aren't blue", or "you have no blue shards".
- **Value Hint:** You can give your teammate a clue about the value of their shards, e.g. "this shard is a one", "these shards are twos", "this/these shard(s) aren't threes)", or "you have no threes".

**IMPORTANT!** You must give the total clue, meaning that if you indicate that one shard is a 2 and the other one is also a 2 then you must indicate that both are 2s instead. e.g. if somebody has a 1 spot water shard and a 1 spot fire shard, then instead of saying "This is a one" pointing to the fire shard you must say "These are ones" pointing to both shards.

### Discard a Shard

If you choose to discard a shard, you must flip a penny from tails to heads. If there are no tails up pennies then you cannot discard a shard. To discard a shard, you must select one of the shards from your hand (without looking at it) to put into a separate discard pile. Once you've discarded the card, you will then select a new tree from Gigol Jungle to search. When the blink is placed properly in front of you (LEDs pointing away from you) then double click it to show your teammate your new shard.

### Play a Shard

When you play a card you are indicating that you believe you have the next shard for a gem. You start by statying that you are playing a shard and selecting one of the shards from your hand to play. If the shard can create a new gem or extend an existing gem it is playable. If the shard duplicates a shard that has already been played or cannot properly extend an existing gem (e.g. three spot shard extends a two spot shard, three spot shard cannot be added to a one spot shard) then one of the nickels must be removed and the nickel and shard are added to the discard pile. Once you've played the card, either by adding it to the gems in the middle of the table or placing it in the discard pile, you will then select a new tree from Gigol Jungle to search. When the blink is placed properly in front of you (LEDs pointing away from you) then double click it to show your teammate your new shard.

## The Gems

You will put the gems back together in the middle of the table. There are three shards to a gem, a single 1 spot shard, a single 2 spot shard, and a single 3 spot shard. The shards must be added together in the proper order, you must create the gem with the 1 spot shard, then add the 2 spot shard, and finish it with the 3 spot shard. You will have 3 separate groups of shards, fire, earth, and water.

**IMPORTANT!** When you have successfully completed a gem by playing a 3 spot shard, you can flip a penny from tails to heads thus giving your team another clue.

## Ending the Game

There are three ways the game can end:

1. You run out of nickels, once you've burned both your resources, you cannot search for any more shards and must end the game empty handed with 0 points.
2. You complete the fire, earth, and water gems from 1 to 3 spots. You have successfully completed the game with the highest possible score of 9.
3. If you draw the last tree into your hand to search, then each player only has one more turn. After the last turn, you add up the score based on the highest spotted shard for each gem. Use the following scale to rate your game:

0-3: You have really let down the tribes of Gigol Jungle.
4-6: You are a mediocre explorer.
6-8: Nicely done, the tribes can hunt down the remaining shards.
9: You are praised by the tribe and forever hold a position of high esteem in their society!
