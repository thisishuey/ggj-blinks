# Setup

## You will need...

- **Players:** 2
- **Blinks:** 18
- **Pennies:** 3 (used as counter)
- **Nickels:** 2 (used as counter)

## Blinks

When the blinks first load, you will see them cycling between 3 elements, fire shard (red)), earth shard (yellow), water shard (blue. You will also notice that in their starting state they have a single spot on the fire shard that changes location on each cycle.

To switch the color of the shard you will need to long press the shard and it will cycle between fire, earth, and water. You will need to make six of each color of shards. Once you are done changing the colors you should have six shards that indicate one fire, one earth, and one water respectively.

To switch the number of spots on a shard you will need to triple click the shard and it will cycle between one, two, and three spots. You need to leave three of the shards of each color as one spot shards, you will need to make two shards of each color into two spot shards, and you will need to make one shard of each color a three spot shard.

Now that you have three one spot shards, two two spot shards, and one three spot shard of each color, double click the shard to put it face down, the shard should now be a dim green color, this represents the treetops of Gigol Jungle.
