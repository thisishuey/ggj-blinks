# Setup

## You will need...

- **Players:** 2
- **Blinks:** 18
- **Pennies:** 3 (used as counter)
- **Nickels:** 2 (used as counter)

## Blinks

When the blinks first load, you will see them cycling between 3 elements, fire shard (red)), earth shard (yellow), water shard (blue. You will also notice that in their starting state they have a single spot on the fire shard that changes location on each cycle.

To switch the color of the shard you will need to long press the shard and it will cycle between fire, earth, and water. You will need to make 6 of each color of shards. Once you are done changing the colors you should have 6 shards that indicate fire, earth, and water respectively.

To switch the number of spots on a shard you will need to triple click the shard and it will cycle between 1, 2, and 3 spots. You need to leave three of the shards of each color as 1 spot shards, you will need to make two shards of each color into 2 spot shards, and you will need to make one shard of each color a 3 spot shard.

Now that you've setup the shards, double click each one to put it face down, the shard should now be a dim green color, this is a "face down" blink that represents the treetops of Gigol Jungle.
